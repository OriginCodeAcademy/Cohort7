# Very Simple Todo App

# DUE EOD Thursday

In this project you are going to build a Todo app using AngularJS that allows users to enter their todo items and prioritize them based on their importance.

The app will then allow users to sort their todo items based on the priority, or by alphabetical order.

## Tasks
1. Create a folder named `04-VSTDA` in your `dev` folder.
2. Setup your Git workflow.
  - Initialize an empty git repository in `04-VSTDA` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
  - Create a repository on GitHub called `04-VSTDA` and follow the instructions to add a remote origin.
3. Open this folder in your favorite text editor (Ours is Sublime!)
4. Create an `index.html` file.
5. Design your HTML page to look like the screenshot using Bootstrap or another preferred design framework.
6. Make use of the following AngularJS features to build this application.
	- Two way data binding using the `ng-model` directive and one way data binding using the `{{}}` bindings (commonly called moustache brackets!).
	- Click event binding using the `ng-click` directive.
	- Dynamic CSS using the `ng-class` directive.
	- Iteration using the `ng-repeat` directive.
	- Filtering using Angular Filters. (Research what these are first!)

## Extras
With any project, you are free to add any extras once you have satisfied the base requirements. Here are some suggestions:

- Can you find a third party Angular library that allows users to reorder todo items by dragging and dropping?
